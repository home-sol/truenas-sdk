## Methods

### NewSystemShutdown0

`func NewSystemShutdown0() *SystemShutdown0`

NewSystemShutdown0 instantiates a new SystemShutdown0 object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewSystemShutdown0WithDefaults

`func NewSystemShutdown0WithDefaults() *SystemShutdown0`

NewSystemShutdown0WithDefaults instantiates a new SystemShutdown0 object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetDelay

`func (o *SystemShutdown0) GetDelay() int32`

GetDelay returns the Delay field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetDelayOk

`func (o *SystemShutdown0) GetDelayOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetDelayOk returns a tuple with the Delay field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetDelay

`func (o *SystemShutdown0) SetDelay(v int32)`

SetDelay sets Delay field to given value.

### HasDelay

`func (o *SystemShutdown0) HasDelay() bool`

HasDelay returns a boolean if a field has been set.
